# PropGoldenStar Backend Structure

This document outlines the core backend architecture of the PropGoldenStar platform. It covers the technology stack, authentication mechanisms, database and storage solutions, APIs and security protocols, and hosting strategies. This backend forms the main brain of the project, managing data flow, security, and integration between various components.

## 1. Tech + Auth

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime Environment:**  
  - **Node.js:** Executes the backend code with a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- **Framework:**  
  - **Express.js:** A lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs and handling middleware.
- **Language:**  
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** TypeScript is used to ensure static typing, enhanced maintainability, and fewer runtime errors.
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - **bcrypt.js:** For secure password hashing.
  - **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** For token-based authentication and session management.
  - **Passport.js:** To support various authentication strategies, including OAuth.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication:**  
  - Secure user registration and login processes with password hashing using bcrypt.
  - **Token-Based Authentication:** JWT is used to secure API requests and manage sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  - Define and enforce different access levels for buyers, sellers/agents, and tenants.
- **Third-Party Integration:**  
  - Option to integrate OAuth for social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook) as needed.

## 2. DB + Storage

### Database Solutions
- **Primary Database:**  
  - **Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL):**  
    - Stores structured data such as user accounts, property listings, transactions, and logs.
- **NoSQL Database (Optional):**  
  - **MongoDB:**  
    - For unstructured data like asset metadata, user sessions, and other document-based records.
- **ORM / Query Builders:**  
  - **Sequelize / TypeORM:**  
    - Provides an abstraction layer for database interactions, ensuring compatibility with TypeScript and easier query management.

### File & Asset Storage
- **Cloud Storage:**  
  - **AWS S3 (or similar):**  
    - For storing static assets, high-resolution images, and 3D model files.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  
  - Integrate a CDN to cache and deliver static assets quickly across various regions.

## 3. APIs + Security

### API Design
- **RESTful API:**  
  - Developed using Express.js, with endpoints organized for user management, property listings, transactions, AR/VR asset delivery, and support.
  - **Versioning:**  
    - Use versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to manage API changes over time.
- **Optional GraphQL Integration:**  
  - Consider GraphQL for complex querying needs and flexible data retrieval in future iterations.

### Security Measures
- **Encryption & Data Protection:**
  - **HTTPS:**  
    - All API communications must use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
  - **Data Encryption:**  
    - Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.
- **Authentication & Authorization Controls:**
  - Secure endpoints with JWT middleware and enforce role-based access restrictions.
- **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection:**
  - Apply rate limiting to sensitive endpoints to reduce the risk of brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Use logging libraries (e.g., Winston) for tracking requests and errors.
  - Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, New Relic) for real-time performance and security tracking.

## 4. Hosting

### Deployment & Hosting Strategies
- **Cloud Providers:**  
  - Utilize AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable and reliable hosting.
- **Containerization:**  
  - **Docker:**  
    - Containerize the backend application to ensure consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Orchestration:**
  - **Kubernetes / Docker Swarm:**  
    - Use container orchestration to manage scaling, load balancing, and efficient resource allocation.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:**
  - Set up automated pipelines (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI) to handle testing, building, and deployment.
- **Load Balancing:**
  - Implement load balancers to distribute incoming traffic and ensure high availability.
- **Backup & Recovery:**
  - Regularly back up databases and critical storage, and establish a disaster recovery plan to handle unexpected outages.

## Summary

The PropGoldenStar backend is engineered to be robust, secure, and scalable. By leveraging Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, we ensure a performant and maintainable codebase. The combination of relational and NoSQL databases, along with cloud storage and CDN integration, caters to both structured and unstructured data needs. A well-designed RESTful API, fortified with comprehensive security measures, serves as the backbone of the platform. Lastly, modern hosting practices, including containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines, provide the necessary infrastructure for a high-availability, scalable application.
