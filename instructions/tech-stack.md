## 1. Frontend / Backend Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework:**  
  - **React.js:** Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Languages:**  
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For maintainable, scalable, and high-quality code.
- **Markup & Styling:**  
  - **HTML5 & CSS3:** Enhanced with SASS/LESS for styling consistency.
- **3D & AR/VR Libraries:**  
  - **Three.js:** For rendering interactive 3D scenes.
  - **A-Frame:** To simplify the creation of AR/VR experiences using a declarative syntax.
  - **WebXR API:** For native support of immersive AR/VR experiences across browsers.
- **Build Tools & Testing:**  
  - **Webpack & Babel:** For module bundling and modern JavaScript compatibility.
  - **ESLint/Prettier:** To enforce code quality and consistency.
  - **Jest & React Testing Library:** For unit and integration testing.

### Backend

- **Runtime Environment:**  
  - **Node.js:** Handling server-side logic.
- **Framework:**  
  - **Express.js:** For creating RESTful APIs and handling middleware.
- **Languages:**  
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and maintainability.
- **Database Solutions:**  
  - **SQL/NoSQL Options:**  
    - Examples include PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data and MongoDB for unstructured asset metadata.
- **Blockchain Integration:**  
  - **Solidity:** For writing smart contracts that secure property transactions.
  - **Web3.js:** Facilitating interaction with blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum).
- **APIs & Middleware:**  
  - Building secure RESTful endpoints with proper error handling, logging, and data encryption.
- **Testing:**  
  - **Mocha, Chai, or Jest:** For backend unit and integration tests.

## 3. Deployment Steps

### Containerization

- **Docker:**  
  - Create Docker images for the frontend, backend, and database components.
  - Use Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container setups in both development and production.

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  - Use services like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI.
  - **Pipeline Steps:**
    - **Code Quality:** Run linting and formatting checks.
    - **Testing:** Execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - **Build:** Bundle the application and create Docker images.
    - **Deployment:** Automate deployment to staging, followed by production after approval.

### Cloud Deployment

- **Cloud Providers:**  
  - AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting.
- **Orchestration & Scaling:**  
  - Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for container orchestration if needed.
  - Set up auto-scaling and load balancing to handle high user volumes.
- **Static Asset Delivery:**  
  - Host static assets (3D models, images, JS/CSS bundles) on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster access.
- **Environment Management:**  
  - Use environment variables and secure secrets management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

### Post-Deployment

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Implement monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and centralized logging (ELK Stack, AWS CloudWatch) to track performance and errors.
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Regular database backups and disaster recovery strategies.
- **Security Audits:**  
  - Continuous security monitoring and periodic audits to maintain the integrity and safety of the system.
