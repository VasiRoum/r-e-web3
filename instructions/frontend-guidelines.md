# Frontend Guidelines

This document outlines the visual design guidelines for the PropGoldenStar platform. The goal is to create an engaging, modern, and immersive user experience similar to the look and feel of [Atelier's Virtual Economy](https://atelier.net/virtual-economy/). These guidelines cover design and styling, layout and navigation, as well as colors and fonts.

## 1. Design + Styling

- **Design Philosophy:**
  - **Modern & Minimalistic:** Emphasize a clean, uncluttered interface that highlights high-quality visuals and 3D interactions.
  - **Immersive Experience:** Leverage subtle animations and smooth transitions to engage users, especially during AR/VR tours.
  - **User-Centric:** Focus on intuitive design elements that make it easy for users to navigate and explore properties.
  - **Consistency:** Ensure that all visual components maintain a consistent look and feel across the entire platform.

- **Styling Guidelines:**
  - **Responsive Design:** The site must look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Use a mobile-first approach.
  - **Interactive Elements:** Use hover states, micro-interactions, and smooth animations to enhance user engagement.
  - **Visual Hierarchy:** Utilize size, spacing, and contrast to establish a clear hierarchy, ensuring that important elements (e.g., call-to-action buttons, property highlights) stand out.
  - **Imagery & 3D Assets:** Integrate high-quality images and 3D model previews seamlessly into the design. Use placeholders with loading animations for asynchronous content.

## 2. Layout + Navigation

- **Layout Structure:**
  - **Header:** 
    - A fixed (sticky) header that contains the logo, primary navigation links, and a search bar.
    - Responsive design with a collapsible hamburger menu on smaller devices.
  - **Main Content Area:** 
    - A modular grid system that allows for flexible content blocks.
    - Emphasis on spacious layouts with ample white space to avoid visual clutter.
    - Sections that clearly separate property listings, immersive tours, user dashboards, and support areas.
  - **Footer:** 
    - A comprehensive footer that includes links to legal information, social media channels, and additional navigation.
    - Consistent styling that mirrors the overall aesthetic of the site.

- **Navigation Best Practices:**
  - **Intuitive Menu Design:** Keep navigation simple and intuitive with clearly labeled sections.
  - **Breadcrumbs:** Implement breadcrumbs on deeper pages (e.g., property details, dashboard pages) to improve navigation and context.
  - **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Strategically place CTAs (e.g., "Explore in 3D", "Schedule a Visit") to guide users towards conversion.
  - **Accessibility:** Ensure that navigation elements are easily accessible (keyboard navigable, sufficient color contrast, etc.) to comply with accessibility standards.

## 3. Colors + Fonts

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary Colors:**  
    - Choose one or two primary colors that reflect trust, sophistication, and modernity. For instance, deep blues or rich teals can convey security and professionalism.
  - **Secondary Colors:**  
    - Complement the primary colors with softer tones such as light grays or off-whites for backgrounds and supportive elements.
  - **Accent Colors:**  
    - Use vibrant accent colors (e.g., a bright orange or green) sparingly to draw attention to CTAs, interactive elements, or important notifications.
  - **Background & Surface Colors:**  
    - A predominantly light background (or dark mode option) to ensure that content is easily readable and that immersive 3D elements pop on screen.

- **Typography:**
  - **Primary Font:**  
    - Select a modern sans-serif font for headers and major text (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, or Roboto) that is clean and legible.
  - **Secondary Font:**  
    - Consider a complementary font for body text or supporting content that maintains readability and style consistency.
  - **Font Sizing & Hierarchy:**  
    - Define clear font sizes and weights for headings (H1, H2, H3), body text, and captions.
    - Maintain consistency across all pages with established guidelines for margins, line-heights, and spacing.
  - **Web-Safe & Load Performance:**  
    - Ensure fonts are web-optimized and load quickly, using services like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts with proper fallback fonts defined.

## Additional Visual Considerations

- **Imagery:**  
  - Use high-resolution images for property listings and backgrounds.  
  - Maintain a consistent style for imagery to ensure a harmonious look across the site.
  
- **Icons & Graphics:**  
  - Utilize a unified icon set that matches the overall aesthetic.
  - Use SVG icons where possible for scalability and crisp rendering.
  
- **Animations:**  
  - Apply subtle, performance-friendly animations to transitions and interactive elements.
  - Avoid overly complex animations that may hinder performance or distract from content.

- **Consistency & Branding:**  
  - All design elements should reflect the brand identity of PropGoldenStar, emphasizing innovation, trust, and sophistication.
  - Document and use a style guide for developers and designers to ensure a consistent visual language across the project.
