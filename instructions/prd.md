## Intro

**Project Name:** PropGoldenStar  
**Overview:**  
PropGoldenStar is a pioneering digital real estate platform designed to transform the property buying and selling experience. By combining immersive AR/VR technologies with secure blockchain-based transactions, the platform provides an interactive environment where users can explore properties in detail, engage directly with sellers/agents, and complete transactions with enhanced security and transparency.

**Objectives:**

- **Immersive Experience:** Enable users to virtually tour properties through AR/VR integration.
- **Secure Transactions:** Implement blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof ownership verification and secure payment processing.
- **User-Centric Design:** Provide a responsive, intuitive interface that simplifies the property discovery and transaction process.
- **Efficiency:** Streamline property listings and interactions by reducing traditional intermediaries, ultimately accelerating the sales process.

## Flow

The overall user and system flow for PropGoldenStar is designed to ensure a seamless experience from discovery to transaction. The following outlines the primary flows:

1. **User Onboarding & Authentication:**
   - Users (buyers, sellers/agents, tenants) register or log in using secure authentication methods (including OAuth and two-factor authentication).

2. **Landing Page & Property Discovery:**
   - Users land on the homepage featuring key property highlights and navigation to detailed listings.
   - A search/filter system allows users to quickly find properties based on criteria such as location, price, and type.

3. **Property Listing & Details:**
   - The Property Listings page displays available properties with thumbnail images, basic details, and quick access to more information.
   - On selecting a property, users view detailed information including property descriptions, images, and key metrics.

4. **Immersive AR/VR Tour:**
   - Users can launch an immersive 3D experience:
     - **3D Interactive Mode:** Rotate, zoom, and explore a detailed 3D model of the property.
     - **AR Mode:** Use mobile devices to project the property into a real-world setting.
     - **VR Mode:** For users with VR headsets, experience a fully immersive property walkthrough.
   - Interactive hotspots provide additional insights into specific property features.

5. **User Dashboard & Transaction Flow:**
   - Registered users access a personalized dashboard to view saved properties, manage listings, track transactions, and access support.
   - Secure payment gateway integration allows users to initiate and complete transactions.
   - Blockchain-backed smart contracts verify ownership and record transactions immutably.

6. **Post-Transaction & Support:**
   - Confirmation of completed transactions is provided, along with digital receipts and blockchain audit trails.
   - A support/help section is available for user inquiries and troubleshooting.
